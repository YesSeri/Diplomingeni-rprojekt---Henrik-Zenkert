\section{Context, Gap, Innovation and Evaluation OR Abstract?}

DBC Digital operates a fleet of servers specified, built, and deployed
using Nix files stored in a Git repository. They want to monitor build
provenance and the system state, to ensure each server matches its
intended configuration with only expected differences. 
Currently, DBC Digital maps Nix store paths to Git commits in a CSV file, and uses a PHP script to query servers systems state and display the data. This approach provides some traceability but is slow, limited in
interactivity, requires SSH access to all servers (a security risk), and
integrates poorly with existing systems.

This project will build a secure and integrated system for monitoring and
maintaining mappings between Nix store paths and Git revisions, with
history, across a fleet of servers.
At a minimum, the system should match the PHP script's functionality, while offering improved security and performance. Stretch goals include
making the tool easy to deploy in a plug-and-play manner, ensuring it is user-friendly and well-documented as an open-source project, and further enhancing usability.
