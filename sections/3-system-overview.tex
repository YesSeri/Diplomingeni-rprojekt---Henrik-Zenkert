\section{Overview of the Proposed System}
\subsection{Motivation and Rationale}
\subsection{Key Components} 
Here I will describe the three key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An activation that is deployed to all servers that are surveilled, that records all Nix activations and that also makes the data available
    \item A scraper that scrapes the data from the activation logger and pushes it to the server that displays the data
    \item Back end and front end for displaying data
\end{itemize}
