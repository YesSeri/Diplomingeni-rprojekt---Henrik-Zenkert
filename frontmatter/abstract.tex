\section*{Abstract}

Modern distributed infrastructures rely on reproducibility and traceability to ensure reliable and predictable operation across large fleets of servers. This thesis addresses that challenge in the context of NixOS-based systems deployed across multiple data centres.

The project designs and implements a host overview system that establishes a reliable mapping between Nix store paths and the Git revisions from which they were built. This mapping enables two key capabilities:
(1) Cluster consistency analysis, allowing operators to verify whether nodes across a cluster are running system images produced from the same Git commit; and
(2) Reproducibility verification, by detecting when distinct Git commits generate identical Nix store paths, thereby confirming that source changes do not affect the resulting system image.

Embedding commit hashes directly into system builds is infeasible, as it introduces recursive dependencies and breaks Nix reproducibility guarantees. Instead, this work develops a distributed data-collection and aggregation service that captures runtime system metadata across hundreds of servers and correlates it with information from the build pipeline.

The resulting system provides high-confidence provenance tracking for NixOS deployments and offers a foundation for improved observability, auditing, and debugging of large-scale Nix-based infrastructures.
